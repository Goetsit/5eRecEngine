# 5eRecEngine

This is a WIP, as a result I do not guarentee anything works properly, I'll just be commiting as I go really.
Expanding into graph databases with Neo4J.
This will utilize the dbd5e open api, python, and Neo4J/Cypher

Looking to start small with item recommendations and eventually grow into possible action or spell recs as well

TODOs and stuff:

-- send rarity and item type in params. improve performance and it'll be a nicer call on the api to filter down on those options there and then further narrow down the returned list after

-- incorporate main class proficiency 

-- allow to ignore class proficiencies

-- query builder and sender

-- allow creation of characters for character specific recommendations




big todos

-- spell recommendations

-- feat recommendations based on primary roles and classes

-- create a gui eventually (bleh)

-- Monster recommendations based on CR, env, etc??? maybe
