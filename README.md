# 5eRecEngine

This is a WIP, as a result I do not guarentee anything works properly, I'll just be commiting as I go really.
Expanding into graph databases with Neo4J.
This will utilize the dbd5e open api, python, and Neo4J/Cypher

Looking to start small with item recommendations and eventually grow into possible action or spell recs as well

TODO:

hook up db
